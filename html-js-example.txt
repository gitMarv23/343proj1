Notes on an HTML + CSS + JS example
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Main HTML file is js-1.html, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css, a very simple CSS file.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads a script file from assets with fcns.
6. After that, another Script section defines another function.
7. And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.

8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.
